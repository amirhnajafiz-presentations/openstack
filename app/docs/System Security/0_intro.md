# Computer Systems Security

Security is the degree of resistance to, or protection from, harm.
It applies to any vulnerable and valuable asset.

Computer Security is about CIA:

- Confidentiality : Keeping data hidden and protected from unauthorized disclosure.
- Integrity : Data and programs are modified in specified and authorized ways.
- Availability : Systems and networks are available for use by legitimate users.

## Why is it hard?

1. Security often not a primary consideration
2. Feature-rich systems tend to be complex
3. Implementations are buggy
4. Networks are more open and accessible than ever
5. Many attacks exploit the weakest link in the chain which is humans
